          MoveVM-based integrated L1+L2 blockchain protocol
        description: |
          - **Tech Stack**: Go, Move, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, GCP
          - **About the Service**: Initia is a platform that enables developers to easily build interoperable custom L2 rollups. As a core engineer, I was solely responsible for designing and implementing the **End-to-End architecture** of the L1-L2 bridge system and the membership (VIP) system.

            **1. Cosmos SDK + MoveVM Integration & Standard SDK Development**
            * **Designed and implemented Aptos MoveVM-based Cosmos SDK execution layer** ([MoveVM](https://github.com/initia-labs/movevm))
              - Developed the `x/move` module to port Aptos MoveVM to Cosmos SDK runtime. To prevent data fragmentation between Cosmos SDK's `x/bank` store and MoveVM's Fungible Asset resources, we maintained a Keeper delegation structure that centralizes balance and supply management authority in MoveVM.
              - Built a bidirectional mapping pipeline connecting Cosmos's `Denom` system with Move's `Object-Metadata` address system, integrating Move assets without disrupting existing Cosmos wallet and explorer environments.

            * **Built heterogeneous data serialization pipeline for MoveVM execution** ([Initia core](http://github.com/initia-labs/initia))
              - The hybrid structure combining Cosmos SDK (Protobuf) and MoveVM (BCS) creates double encoding complexity during transaction creation.
              - Implemented a builder pipeline that serializes JS parameters into **BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization)** and then injects them into **Protobuf** transaction payloads.
              - Abstracted the complex serialization process into a single API call, improving dApp integration productivity for in-house and partner teams.

            * **Fine-tuned connection pool for RPC communication stability (SDK)** ([initia.js](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia.js))
              - During initial dApp startup, dozens of RPC requests caused load balancer imbalance and **socket hang-up** errors.
              - Rather than unconditionally maintaining connections, we precisely tuned **`KeepAliveMsecs`** and **`MaxSockets`** parameters to match traffic patterns and added automatic retry logic.
              - Eliminated unnecessary handshake costs to stabilize latency and reduced connection drop frequency during long-term operation to ensure communication reliability.
              - With the business strategy shift from the initial Cosmos standard (CoinType 118) structure to EVM compatibility (CoinType 60) support, we designed a flexible architecture by separating the `BIP-44 standard`-based address and signature modules to dynamically switch CoinType at runtime. As a result, we prevented fragmentation between heterogeneous chains by supporting both Initia L1 and EVM L2 with a single SDK.

            **2. End-to-End construction of Initia incentive tokenomics**

            * **Designed Initia incentive system ([VIP contract](https://github.com/initia-labs/vip-contract))**
              - Built a fully on-chain & verifiable incentive protocol
              1. Made on-chain the core logic that recognizes L2 deposited assets as L1 security stake (Staking) to ensure transparency and verifiability.
              2. Dynamic Snapshot Pipeline: Real-time recording of L2 TVL and user activity scores in Table structures, combining them with Cosmos Voting Power to implement dynamic reward calculation logic verifiable by anyone on-chain.
              - Designed Merkle Proof-based incentive distribution architecture
              1. Shifted from directly pushing rewards to tens of thousands of users to a pull-based (User Claim) approach where operators only update the Merkle Root on-chain. This reduced operator transaction frequency, saving over 99% in gas costs and minimizing network load.
              2. While requiring users to submit proof themselves creates a UX hurdle compared to real-time automatic distribution, this is a necessary trade-off for scalability and verifiability. Users can independently verify the legitimacy of their rewards through the on-chain Root at any time.
              3. Established safeguards by setting a Challenge Window period for incorrect Root submissions, enabling operators to immediately rollback or correct improper data, ensuring on-chain data integrity.
              - Advanced contract logic and security improvements
              1. Eliminated asset commingling risks and strengthened ownership structure by isolating user-specific Staking Positions as independent Objects based on `ExtendRef` (object control rights) - a Move language feature.
              2. Implemented on-chain logic enforcing limits on Commission change magnitude and Reward Pool withdrawal caps to prevent malicious operator behavior.

            * **Built End-to-End dApp infrastructure (API, Indexer, Bot)**
              - When submitting reward calculation data, the node query-based nonce lookup approach caused Nonce Mismatch and cascading failures due to network delays. Built a Managed Nonce System that directly manages nonce at the application layer to maximize parallel processing speed.
              - To prevent the 'data loss on abnormal process termination' risk inherent in in-memory nonce management, implemented a Persistence-based Retry mechanism that persists failed or unprocessed transactions to DB.
              - Achieved fully automated operation without manual intervention, successfully processing thousands of snapshot submission transactions without loss. Achieved 24/7 uptime with a Failover system that immediately switches to backup nodes during RPC Node failures.

            **3. DevRel & Ecosystem Growth (2025)**
            * **Partnership management and technical guidance**
              Led third-party onboarding and provided technical guides, managing partnerships ([Initia Official Docs](https://github.com/initia-labs/docs)).
            * **Technical content creation for ecosystem expansion**
              Contributed to ecosystem education and expansion through research articles, presentations, and technical/community-targeted content ([Mammothon](https://mammothon.celestia.org/)).
            * **Global community event planning and operation**
              Planned and presented at community events, conducted developer sessions ([ETHCC 2024](https://ethcc.io/)).
            * **Developer documentation and tutorial writing**
              Wrote comprehensive documentation and tutorials to accelerate developer adoption and user growth.

          - **Tech Stack**: Go, Rust (CosmWasm), TypeScript, Python, Tendermint Core
          - **About the Service**: Developed core modules for the Terra blockchain and participated in technical migration for network reconstruction (Terra 2.0) following a major ecosystem collapse.

          **1. State Rent mechanism R&D for blockchain storage efficiency**
          - Researched node storage economic models to solve the chronic blockchain problem of State Bloat (state data expansion).
          - Designed and prototyped a **State Rent mechanism** that differentially charges fees proportional to data occupation period and size.

          **2. Core SDK emergency migration for Terra 2.0 genesis launch**
          - During network hard fork (Phoenix-1) and reconstruction, redesigned client library architecture ([terra.js](https://github.com/terra-money/terra.js), [terra.py](https://github.com/terra-money/terra.py)) to restore the ecosystem.
          - Enhanced SDK communication module transaction builders to align with changed Gas Policy and signature specifications to new specs.
          - Supported immediate integration for exchanges and dApps on mainnet 2.0 launch day, minimizing ecosystem gaps and securing low-level technical capabilities across the entire blockchain interaction lifecycle from signing to propagation to indexing.

          On-chain data platform for global cryptocurrency investors
        description: |
          - **Tech Stack**: Python, PostgreSQL
          - **About the Service**: Processes on-chain data from major chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing investors with key metrics such as whale wallet movements and exchange flows.

          **1. In-house node construction and large-scale on-chain data pipeline optimization**
          - Faced rising costs and architectural limitations due to initial reliance on third-party nodes (Infura, etc.) with processed data focus.
          - Built in-house nodes (Geth) directly and redesigned from a processed data-centric storage approach to a flexible pipeline that stores Raw Data (Block/Tx/Trace) then performs ETL processing (Post-processing).
          - Reduced external infrastructure costs by **over 80%** and established a data environment enabling immediate calculation of new metrics on historical data.

          **2. Migration from Elasticsearch to RDB and query performance enhancement**
          - Needed to solve data consistency (ACID) limitations and inefficient complex relational query (Join) processing in the existing Elasticsearch-based architecture.
          - Migrated the main storage to **PostgreSQL** to ensure financial-grade data integrity, applying table partitioning strategies and Materialized Views tailored to time-series characteristics.
          - Ultimately shortened complex on-chain metric query speeds and completed a stable tracking structure for large-scale transaction data.
